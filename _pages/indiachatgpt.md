Bharat GPTs: India’s only multilingual Large Language Model
========


Generative AI technology for multilingual India.
=====
* At **Bharat GPTs: India’s first multilingual Large Language Model (LLM)**, we are dedicated to providing generative AI technology to billion speakers of 22 official Indian languages. The current state-of-the-art  Gen AI Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology caters only to English and European world but they fail heavily for morphological rich Indian languages of non Roman script.

* We are here to develop **GenAI NLP technology** heavily focusing on **Indo-Aryan**, **Indo-Dravidian**, and **Sibo-Tibetan** languages to make billion speakers of Indian languages to leverage advanced generative AI technology with their native languages and work towards building inclusive NLP technology for non developed world and preserve the beautiful linguistically rich and diverse Indian languages with advanced GenAI technology.

* We aim to provide various **NLP technology** such as **text generation**, **text completion**, **text summarization**, **language translation**, **chat bot** for **Question Answering** from rich literature, and various domains for Indo-Aryan and Indo-Dravidian languages.

* As of now in collaboration with **Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur**, we have developed large language models (LLMs) for 9 Indian languages: Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Dogri, Hindi, Konkani, Maithili, Odia, and Sanskrit covering three distinct scripts: Assamese-Bengali, Devanagari, and Odia. Our models have outperformed popular LLMs  for open-end text generation for Indian languages. We will soon publish our research paper, stay tuned!

* We plan to include Dravidian languages soon, curate more data, train bigger models, and deploy them to the cloud so that billion users across world can use our models for their day to day need in their native language as ai-as-service.

* We are **seeking for grants/funds** to curate data, include more languages, train models, chat-tune/instruction tune the existing models by renting GPU clusters, hiring linguists, translators, and engineers to deploy our **LLMs** on the cloud by developing robust infrastructure and provide Gen AI as service to our users across the globe.
